Welcome to documentation of sOcean Smart Multiple Model Software Project!
===================================

**sOcean** is a Python/Cpp software project for extended object semantic/kinematic state estimation from the Smart Sensor Fusion Research Laboratory at the University of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SSF at SJTU). The estimation **World Model** consists of two major parts: i) **Dynamic World**: extended object multiple model tracking ii) **Static World**: semantic object estimation for mapping and map learning.

In the Dynamic World The Tracking part is focused on developing an extended object multiple model tracking toolbox for autonomous systems. The toolbox
