Welcome to documentation of sOcean Smart Multiple Model Software Project!
===================================

**sOcean** is a Python/Cpp software project for extended object semantic/kinematic state estimation from the Smart Sensor Fusion Research Laboratory at the University of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SSF at SJTU). The estimation framework forms a **World Model** consisting of two major parts: i) **Dynamic World**: extended object multiple model tracking ii) **Static World**: semantic object estimation for mapping and map learning.

In the Dynamic World,  efforts are put on developing an extended object multiple model tracking toolbox for particularly autonomous systems. The toolbox
