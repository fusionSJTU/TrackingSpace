===========

The World Model consists of the following major 17D perception information
	* position (3D)
	* dynamic (3D, including 3D velocity and/or acceleration) 
	* shape (3D, width, height and length or other 3D shape representation)
	* color pattern (3D, RGB or YUV)
	* categorization (label list)
	* spatial correlation (such as cluster ID, occupancy state)
	* temporal correlation (such as track ID and track history)
	* credibility/consistency (health/sanity check for the system and modules/nodes)
	* processing indicator (such as de-noised, whitened, clustered and tracked)
and other application-dependent status information, such as
	* temporature 
	* humidity
	* odemetry
